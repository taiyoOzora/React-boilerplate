Password Strength is a library that calculates the relative strength of a password. This is accomplished by using several techniques. Primarily this relies on letter trigraphs, which check each set of 3 characters in a given password. More information on the trigraph calculations is available. This also calculates the entropy bits based on Claude Shannon's technique on determining the number of bits required to represent a set of characters and multiplying it by the length of the password. There is also a check to see if a password is contained in a list of common passwords.
